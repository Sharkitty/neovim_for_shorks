# A Neovim config made for shorks!
Can be shared with feeshes as well!

This is just a personnal config of Neovim I'm working on. It uses `Lazy` as its plugin manager, and `Aura` as its default theme.

## Installation
### On Linux
Go to your `~/.config` directory:
```cd ~/.config```

Clone this repository:
```git clone https://github.com/Sharkitty/neovim_for_shorks.git```

or

```git clone git@github.com:Sharkitty/neovim_for_shorks.git```

Rename the created directory:
```mv neovim_for_shorks nvim```

Open neovim, Lazy should install the included plugins.

Use `:checkhealth` to make sure eveything is daijoubu.

Finally, open `:Mason` to install any lsp server, DAP, linter or formater you might need.


## Compatibility
This configuration has only been tested with neovim 0.9.x and on linux. Compatibility with older versions of neovim and other OS isn't assured.
